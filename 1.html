  <h2>FORM</h2>
  <p>
    Form refers to the shape or configuration of a building.
    Form and its opposite, space, constitute primary elements
    of architecture. The reciprocal relationship is essential,
    given the intention of architecture to provide internal
    sheltered space for human occupation. Both form and space
    are given shape and scale in the design process. In addition,
    the placement of a building form in relation to its immediate
    site and neighboring buildings is another crucial aspect of
    this form/space relationship. Just as internal space is created
    by voids in building form, exterior space can be defined or
    poorly defined by the building form as well.
