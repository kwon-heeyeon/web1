  Architecture (Latin architectura, from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων arkhitekton
  "architect", from archi "chief" and tecture "creator") is both the process
  and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings
  or other structures.

  as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often
  identified with their surviving architectural achievements.</p>
