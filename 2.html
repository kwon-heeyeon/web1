  <h2>FUNCTION</h2>
  <p>
    In architecture, functionalism is the principle that buildings
    should be designed based solely on the purpose and function of
    the building.
    This principle is a matter of confusion and controversy within
    the profession, particularly in regard to modern architecture,
    as it is less self-evident than it first appears.
    The theoretical articulation of functionalism in buildings can be
    traced back to the Vitruvian triad, where utilitas (variously translated
    as 'commodity', 'convenience', or 'utility') stands alongside firmitas
    (firmness) and venustas (beauty) as one of three classic goals of
    architecture. Functionalist views were typical of some Gothic Revival
    architects. In particular, Augustus Welby Pugin wrote that "there
    should be no features about a building which are not necessary for
    convenience, construction, or propriety" and "all ornament should
    consist of enrichment of the essential construction of the building".
